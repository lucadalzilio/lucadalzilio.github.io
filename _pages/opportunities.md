<p style='text-align: justify;'> One of my favorite parts of my job is the opportunity to work with motivated and ambitious students and postdocs who share common interests on various problems in mechanics, geophysics, numerical methods and scientific computing.

Prospective Undergraduate Students / Ph.D. students / Post-docs: if you are interested in working with me, write me an e-mail with subject "Prospective student - YOURNAME", attaching your CV, a brief description of your research interests, why you are interested in working with me, and any relevant material. You can find details about doctoral programs at NTU here. </p>

I offer numerous projects covering a wide range of subjects in Geophysics, Geology, Computational Science, and Mechanical Engineering:

• Earthquake physics

• Fluid injection and induced seismicity to study anthropogenic energy-related activities

• Subduction dynamics across the scale: from tectonics to dynamic rupture

• Earthquake cycle simulations coupling fluids and viscoelastic rheologies

• Seismic swarms, foreshocks, and slow-slip events

• Bringing solvers to extreme scale simulations in geodynamics/earthquake physics

• Develop high-performance software, and use it to facilitate cutting-edge simulations

• Implementation of parallel computing and shared memory libraries

If you are passionate about geophysics, continuum mechanics, and numerical modeling, don't hesitate to get in touch!
