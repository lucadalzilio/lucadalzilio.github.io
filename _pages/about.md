<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am an Assistant Professor of Geophysics at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg" target="_blank">Nanyang Technological University</a> (<strong>NTU</strong>) in Singapore and a Principal Investigator at the <a href="https://earthobservatory.sg" target="_blank">Earth Observatory of Singapore</a> (<strong>EOS</strong>), where I lead the <a href="https://computational-geophysics-lab.github.io/cgl.github.io/" target="_blank">Computational Geophysics Lab</a> (<strong>CGL</strong>). My work focuses on understanding natural hazards like earthquakes, tsunamis, and crustal deformation, as well as exploring geoenergy solutions such as enhanced geothermal systems and carbon storage. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> I use numerical modeling and geophysical data to study the underlying mechanics of faulting, fluid flow, and large-scale geodynamic processes. By combining simulations with observational data, I aim to improve our ability to predict and mitigate natural hazards. My research also addresses the challenges posed by human-induced activities, such as fluid injection, with applications to sustainable energy and environmental protection. </p>
