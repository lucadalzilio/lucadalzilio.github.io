I am an Assistant Professor of Geophysics at Nanyang Technological University ([NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg)) in Singapore and a Principal Investigator at the Earth Observatory of Singapore ([EOS](https://earthobservatory.sg)), leading the Computational Geophysics Lab. I am a computational geoscientist focused on studying natural hazards, with a strong interest in the mechanics of fracture, frictional sliding, and multiphase flow in porous media.

My research combines theory, physics-based simulations, and laboratory experiments to characterise and understand earthquakes, crustal deformation, tsunamis, and similar phenomena. Specific focus is on identifying the fundamental mechanical processes governing a system of interest, developing numerical models incorporating these processes, validating them using geophysical observations, and then using the models to predict system behaviour. Research areas include earthquake rupture dynamics, earthquake source processes, tsunami generation, large-scale geodynamic processes, and geoenergy exploration due to anthropogenic operations involving underground fluid extraction or injection, with applications in enhanced geothermal systems and carbon sequestration.
