## Computational Earthquake Physics

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Modeling earthquake source processes is a multi-physics, multi-scale, societally important endeavor that tightly links several geoscience disciplines. My group leverage both theoretical and computational methods to develop physics-based models and combine them with observations and laboratory experiments. With the use of these models, we aim to capture relevant problems at the societal scales of interest, including scenarios of large destructive earthquakes, prediction of strong ground motion, physics-based estimates of long-term seismic hazard, and potential for induced seismicity. </p>

## Mechanics of porous media

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Unstable porous-media flows are essential to understanding many natural and man-made processes, including water infiltration in rocks, ice-sheet flow, geothermal fluid circulation, and CO2 sequestration, and induced seismicity. My group combines theory and simulations that elucidate fundamental aspects of fluid flow, which we then apply for prediction of large-scale Earth science problems in the areas of energy and the environment, including geological carbon sequestration. We develop software that couples fluid flow in porous and fractured media with thermo-hydro-mechanical models and statistical and physical earthquake modes. </p>
